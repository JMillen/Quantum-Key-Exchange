# Quantum Key Exchange 

## Overview
This repository contains the code from an assignment for the paper Advanced Networking and Cyber Security. The focus of this assignment is the implementation and testing of the Quantum Key Exchange (QKE) algorithm, also known as the BB84 algorithm. The assignment involves secure key exchange using qubits and encryption/decryption of messages with an XOR cipher.


### Key Components:
1. **Qubit Class**: Models the behavior of a qubit with properties such as value and polarization.
2. **XOR Cipher**: A class to encrypt and decrypt messages using the XOR operation.
3. **QKE Algorithm**: Emulates the BB84 quantum key exchange protocol, followed by secure message transmission using the generated key.
4. **Unit Test**: Tests the accuracy of each class with various inputs.
